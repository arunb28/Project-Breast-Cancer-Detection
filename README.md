# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on features computed from digitized images of cell nuclei. The dataset used contains information about malignant and benign tumor cells. The primary objective is to build a classification model that can accurately classify tumors as either benign or malignant.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the project code.
  - `Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipynb`: Main notebook with data loading, exploration, model training, and evaluation.
  
- **Data:** Contains the dataset used in the project.
  - `breast_cancer_data.csv`: Dataset containing features computed from digitized images of cell nuclei.
  
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project, instructions, and thoughts during creation.

## Instructions

### Running the Notebook

1. Open `Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells in order to load data, explore, train the model, and evaluate.

### Dataset

- The dataset (`breast_cancer_data.csv`) is available in the `Data` folder.

### Thoughts During Creation

- Include your thoughts, challenges, and insights during the creation of the project.
- Discuss any decisions made, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

## Results

- Provide insights into the performance of the classification model.
- Include metrics, visualizations, or any relevant findings.

## Future Improvements

- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements to the project.
- Any additional features, models, or optimizations that could be explored.
